## 12. Provenance and attribution

Everything in this paper carries one of five labels, applied consistently
rather than asserted once and forgotten. Consolidated here — previously
scattered across notation, disambiguation, and a per-component table —
because attribution is ongoing, not a one-time note, and belongs in one
place a reader can check against every section.

### The labels

- **`ESTABLISHED`** — mathematics or computer science that predates this
  project, cited to its source.
- **`OURS`** — code or a specific design choice built for this project, not
  published elsewhere.
- **`FIRST STATED HERE`** — a specific claim or construction, dated, not
  found stated this way anywhere else checked.
- **`THEORETICAL`** — designed, or partially attempted, not yet reduced to
  running, verified code.
- **`THEORETICAL:CALCULATED`** — a `THEORETICAL` component for which code
  has nonetheless computed a concrete, reportable result — a measurement, a
  boundary condition, a failed literal construction — without the component
  itself shipping.

### How the code came first

Every mechanism in this paper — the address, the spelling fix, the 19D
context fold, the windspeed recovery — was built directly against the
problem, then checked against the literature afterward, not designed from
it. Correspondences to established mathematics (projective-plane
combinatorics, Gödel positional encoding, Miller–Rabin primality, sedenion
zero-divisor structure, the Joukowsky transform) were noticed once the code
already worked. Where a mathematical name appears in this paper, it is a
label applied after the fact for a reader who already knows it — it played
no role in how the code was written.

### Provenance by component

| component | provenance | status |
|---|---|---|
| token → address (Horner, next_prime, π) | **OURS** — `monad.py`, unaltered since 2026-05-27 | ships |
| the 313 sieve boundary | **ESTABLISHED** — classical sieve theory; "first 65 primes are letters" reading | **OURS** | ships |
| spelling → prime, order-preserving | **OURS**, marked provisional in-source | ships |
| WordNet box-kite table (`monad3_c.bin`) | **ESTABLISHED** WordNet; storage/build **OURS** | ships, C-verified |
| 19D context fold, `context_code`/`gamma_radial` | **ESTABLISHED** WordNet relation vocabulary; encoding **OURS** | ships, exact round trip |
| windspeed recovery `(full_addr,delta,spelling)→gamma_radial` | **OURS**, `FIRST STATED HERE` 2026-09-20 | verified, not yet in `ptol.c` |
| the box kite — 42 Assessors, 7 octahedra, `PSL(2,7)` | **ESTABLISHED** — de Marrais (2000) | cited, not re-derived |
| the pencil — 7 factorisations of one relation | **ESTABLISHED** — projective geometry (PG(3,2)); edge framing **OURS** | ships |
| the Blackjack subgroup (21-element, transitive, ZD-preserving) | **FIRST STATED HERE** 2026-09-17 | verified |
| `Φ_w`, the Joukowsky deformation law | **ESTABLISHED** — Joukowsky (1910), elastica (Euler, 1744), Kutta–Joukowsky; tether/wind-inflation **FIRST STATED HERE** | `THEORETICAL`, partially `:CALCULATED` this pass |
| the `J_2`/`J_N` crossing identity | **ESTABLISHED** (classical complex analysis) — the identification of *which* involution **FIRST STATED HERE** 2026-09-20 | verified exactly |
| `H` conservation on struts `{1,3,6}` | **FIRST STATED HERE** 2026-09-20 | measured, unexplained |
| the cost comparison | **OURS** measurement; the dense-transformer FLOP identity **ESTABLISHED** | measured |
| `observer-position` methodology | **OURS**, `FIRST STATED HERE** 2026-09-20 | in use |

### Licensing

The box-kite context-hashing method and all code described in this
paper — the addressing pipeline, `spelling_code`, `context_code`, the
gamma fold, the windspeed recovery, and every notebook this paper cites —
is released under the **GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPLv3)**.
Free to use, study, modify, and redistribute, for research and commercial
purposes alike, under that license's terms.

This paper describes an address, not the whole system it is a component
of. Nothing in the broader, undisclosed system that address feeds is
required to use, verify, or extend anything described here — every claim
in this paper is complete and reproducible from what is cited in §13,
independent of it.
